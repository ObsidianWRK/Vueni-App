description: Use when starting any conversation - establishes mandatory workflows for finding and using skills, including using Skill tool before announcing usage, alignment before implementation, and creating TodoWrite todos for checklists

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

# Getting Started with Skills

## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Before responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. ☐ List available skills in your mind
2. ☐ Ask yourself: "Does ANY skill match this request?"
3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file
4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using
5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly

**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**

## Enforcement Checklist (MUST Complete Before Any Tool Use)

**This checklist MUST be completed BEFORE using ANY tools (read_file, write, grep, codebase_search, run_terminal_cmd, etc.).**

**Violation Detection:**
- Pre-task hooks (`.claude/hooks/pre-task-skill-check.js`) will block tool execution if this checklist is not completed
- Validation scripts (`scripts/validate_skill_checks.py`) will detect violations in responses
- Multiple enforcement layers ensure compliance

**Enforcement Checklist:**

1. ☐ **STOP** - Before using any tool, ask: "Have I checked for relevant skills?"
2. ☐ If NO → Complete the "MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL" checklist above
3. ☐ If YES → Verify you've announced which skill(s) you're using
4. ☐ **ONLY THEN** proceed with tool usage

**Common Violations:**
- Using `read_file()` before checking skills
- Using `write()` before checking skills  
- Using `grep()` or `codebase_search()` before checking skills
- Starting implementation without skill check
- "Let me read some files first" → WRONG. Check skills FIRST.

**Example Correct Flow:**
```
1. User: "Add authentication"
2. Agent: [STOPS - checks checklist]
3. Agent: openskills read using-skills
4. Agent: openskills read frontend-design
5. Agent: "I've read using-skills and frontend-design skills"
6. Agent: [NOW proceeds with read_file, write, etc.]
```

**Example Violation:**
```
1. User: "Add authentication"
2. Agent: read_file("auth.js")  ← VIOLATION: No skill check first
3. Agent: [Continues without checking skills]
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Check for relevant skills before ANY task.

2. Execute skills with the Skill tool

## Before Coding

**What did you understand about what I just said to you?**

**How will you go about implementing it?**

Please provide:

1. **Clear understanding**: Restate what you think I'm asking for
2. **Step-by-step plan**: Exactly how you will implement it
3. **File changes**: Which files you'll modify/create and what changes
4. **Potential issues**: Any risks, dependencies, or considerations
5. **Success criteria**: How we'll know it's working correctly

**CRITICAL**: Please wait for my review and confirmation before beginning your implementation. Do not start coding until I approve your plan.

This ensures we're aligned before you begin work and prevents miscommunication or wasted effort.

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.

- "This is just a simple question" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.
- "I can check git/files quickly" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.
- "Let me gather information first" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.
- "This doesn't need a formal skill" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.
- "I remember this skill" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.
- "This doesn't count as a task" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.
- "The skill is overkill for this" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.
- "I'll just do this one thing first" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.

**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

If a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**

- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

# About these skills

**Many skills contain rigid rules (debugging, verification, service patterns).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.

**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.

The skill itself tells you which type it is.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip verification, alignment, or proper implementation patterns.

**Red flags:** "Instruction was specific" • "Seems simple" • "Workflow is overkill"

**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## Summary

**Starting any task:**

1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill
2. Announce you're using it
3. Follow what it says

**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.

**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**
