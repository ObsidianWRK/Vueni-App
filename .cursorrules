# Cursor Rules for Vueni App

## OCR Skill Auto-Suggestion

When the user mentions, attaches, or references files with the following extensions, consider suggesting the OCR skill:
- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, `.heic`, `.heif`, `.svg`
- Documents: `.pdf`
- Structured data: `.csv`, `.tsv`

**Trigger conditions:**
- User asks to "extract text", "transcribe", "OCR", "read the image/PDF", or "what does this say"
- User provides screenshot or image and asks about its content
- User mentions error messages, invoices, scans, or documents that might need text extraction
- User asks "what's in [image/pdf file]" or similar content queries

**When to suggest:**
If any of the above conditions are met, proactively mention:
> "I can use the OCR skill to extract text and structured data from your [image/PDF/file]. Would you like me to do that?"

Or if it's clearly OCR-related, just invoke the skill directly:
> "I'll use the OCR skill to extract the text and structured data from [filename]."

**How to invoke:**
- In Cursor: Use `/ocr` slash command or invoke via the Skill tool
- The OCR skill will automatically scan conversation context for files
- The skill can load files using the Read tool if they're not yet in context

**Important:**
- The OCR skill is smart enough to detect files in context, so you don't need to manually list them
- Always check user intent first - if they just mention a file but want to delete/move it, don't suggest OCR
- The skill works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex
