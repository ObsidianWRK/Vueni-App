- **Base score (20 points)**: Must have at least 1 action verb
- **Bonus (10 points)**: 3+ action verbs for full points
- **Common action verbs**: create, build, generate, design, extract, analyze, test, install, use, write, edit, modify, process, develop, implement, guide, help, support, enable, provide

### 2. Keywords (15 points)
- Include relevant domain keywords that help with discovery
- Examples: "frontend", "PDF", "document", "testing", "design", "research"
- Should be natural and contextual, not keyword-stuffed

### 3. File Types (10 points)
- Mention file extensions when applicable (.pdf, .png, .docx, .xlsx, etc.)
- Only applicable for file-format-specific skills
- Use format: "(.pdf files)" or "for .png and .pdf documents"

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: deep-research (45 → 100)

**Before:**
```
Deep research skill combining Perplexity-style iterative depth with Manus-style parallel breadth. Analyzes queries, executes multi-phase research, and produces comprehensive reports with citations, structured data, and visualizations.
```

**Issues:**
- Only 1 action verb (analyzes - "executes" and "produces" are in the same clause)
- No "when to use" guidance
- Technical jargon without natural phrasing
- No use case examples

**After:**
```
Conduct comprehensive research by analyzing queries, executing multi-phase searches, and producing detailed reports with citations, structured data, and visualizations. Use this skill when users request "deep research", "research this", "investigate", or need comprehensive analysis with citations. Combines Perplexity-style iterative depth with Manus-style parallel breadth for thorough coverage of complex topics.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added 3+ action verbs: "Conduct", "analyzing", "executing", "producing"
- Added use cases: "when users request..."
- Added natural phrasing: "Use this skill when..."
- Maintained technical accuracy

### Example 2: expo-ios-designer (60 → 100)

**Before:**
```
Design iOS-first UIs for Expo/React Native apps: layout, typography, safe areas, motion, haptics, and accessibility aligned with iOS conventions.
```

**Issues:**
- Only 1 action verb (Design)
- No "when to use" guidance
- No use case examples

**After:**
```
Design and build iOS-first UIs for Expo/React Native apps with proper layout, typography, safe areas, motion, haptics, and accessibility aligned with iOS conventions. Use this skill when creating mobile interfaces, designing iOS apps, building React Native components, or implementing iOS design patterns.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added action verbs: "Design", "build", "creating", "designing", "building", "implementing"
- Added use cases: "when creating mobile interfaces..."
- Added natural phrasing: "Use this skill when..."
- Maintained technical details

## Template Structure

```
[Action verb 1] and [action verb 2] [core functionality] by [action verb 3] [specific capabilities]. Use this skill when [trigger scenario 1], [trigger scenario 2], or [trigger scenario 3]. [Additional context if needed].
```

**Components:**
1. **Opening action verbs** (3+): Create, build, generate, design, etc.
2. **Core functionality**: What the skill does
3. **Specific capabilities**: How it does it
4. **Use cases**: "Use this skill when..." with examples
5. **Additional context**: Technical details, file types, constraints
